# PBScript

PBScript is a simple scripting language pointed towards usage in games (especially unity and godot+C#).  
The name derrives from "Plant Based Script", as it was originally developed for a small game where one is scripting garden robots.

It allows for easy injection of special actions a player may use by attaching objects with defined actions to the runtime environment.

I will add general language documentation over time, for now the [wiki](https://github.com/Five-Thousand-Kings/TodoGrow.Wiki/wiki) for the garden game might be the best starting point.

### nuget:
```sh
# coming soon, i guess
```



# Caution
The current version of PBScript is feature complete and *somewhat* tested for functionality, but the api may change in the future.
