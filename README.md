# PBScript

PBScript is a simple scripting language pointed towards usage in games (especially unity and godot+C#).  
The name derrives from "Plant Based Script", as it was originally developed for a small game I am working on.

It allows for easy injection of special actions a player may use by attaching objects with defined actions to the runtime environment.

For a compact documentation of PBScript look into the [Documentation](Documentation/Index.html) (HIGHLY W.I.P. + many upcoming changes! Lang is not stable yet!)


# Caution
The current version of PBScript is well tested in regards of functionality, but the api, language features, syntax, ... may (and propably will to some extend) change in the future and there may still be some untested parts.
