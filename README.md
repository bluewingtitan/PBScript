# PBScript

PBScript is a simple scripting language pointed towards usage in games (especially unity and godot+C#).  
The name derrives from "Plant Based Script", as it was originally developed for a small game where one is scripting garden robots.

It allows for easy injection of special actions a player may use by attaching objects with defined actions to the runtime environment.

For a compact documentation of PBScript look into the [Documentation](Documentation/Index.html)

### nuget:
```sh
# coming soon, i guess
```



# Caution
The current version of PBScript is *mostly* tested for functionality, but the api and functionality may (and propably will) change in the future and there may still be some untested parts.
