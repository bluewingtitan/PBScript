# PBScript

PBScript is a simple scripting language pointed towards usage in games (especially unity and godot+C#). 
The name derrives from "Plant Based Script", as it was originally developed for a small game where one is scripting garden robots.

I will add general language documentation over time, for now the [wiki](https://github.com/Five-Thousand-Kings/TodoGrow.Wiki/wiki) for the garden game might be the best starting point.
